Project Overview

variables: gene expression, electrophysiology 

cell types: CA3 pyrimidal cells v.s. layer4 Entorhinal Cortex  

Research Question: Are there any similaries/differences among the spikes interval/firing rate of CA3 pyrimal cells and layer4 Entorhinal Cortex that can be related with the differences in gene expression?
